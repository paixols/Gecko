### Gecko Project

This is a simple project used as an architecture guideline for Android Development using 
the Clean Code paradigm by use case scenario, and multi module approach. 

The project uses the free version of Coin Gecko API as the data source, and displays a few
famous crypto coins available in the market place, as well as their price in USD and BTC. 

Enjoy ;)
